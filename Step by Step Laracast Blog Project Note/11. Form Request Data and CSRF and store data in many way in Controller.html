 #dd():
 Use for dd
	 public function store()
	    {
	        dd(request()->all());
	    }
	Note: It receive data from "Input Form" and assign to array and show the data;
	another:
	dd(request('body'));
	dd(request(['body', 'title']));


#Store Function
	public function store(/*Request $request*/)
    {
        //Create a new post using the request data
        $post = new Post();

        $post->title = request('title');
        $post->body = request('body');

        //Save it to the database
        $post->save();

        //And then redirect to the home page.
        return redirect('/');
    }


    Another:
    public function store(/*Request $request*/)
    {
        Post::create([
            'title' => request('title'),
            'body' => request('body')
        ]);

        //And then redirect to the home page.
        return redirect('/');
    }
    Note:First of all it gives a error name-"Illuminate \ Database \ Eloquent \ MassAssignmentException"
    -it means that if we not doing any validation or climsing and it allows the user smit any form data whatever they want.
    -User can always html form in browser and change input or add input
    -In Model
    	class Post extends Model
		{
		    protected $fillable = ['title', 'body'];
		}
		Note: If we give only the field we are basically ok for MassAssign

	-However this $fillable get anoying so we have chooise like $gurded sort of like inverse....
		-fillable mean we accept but gurded mean we don't allow, it basicaly a filter
	Example:
		class Post extends Model
		{
		    protected $guarded = [];//this means we do not guardeing anything
		}
		Note: this means we don't gurded anything but if we use 
				class Post extends Model
				{
				    protected $guarded = ['user_id'];
				}
				it means we don't gurded anything accept 'user_id' 


#Create Custom Model and use it 

Model.php:
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model as Eloquent;

class Model extends Eloquent
{
    protected $guarded = [];
}


Post.php:
<?php

namespace App;
use App;

class Post extends Model
{

}

Note: Here we create our own Model name Model and in Post.php  we extends our own model and this $gurded works every child Model class and it automatically inherete
