Step 1:
	run this command "php artisan make:auth"
	If we go to the web.php we can see "Auth::routes();" which responsable for login, signin, password reset etc.

Step 2: If we see the .env file we can connect database many ways
	In .env file  we can connect "DB_CONNECTION=sqlite" and 
		"DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
		DB_PORT=3306
		DB_DATABASE=homestead
		DB_USERNAME=homestead
		DB_PASSWORD=secret"

	 file must be deleted  and the sqlite which is file base database
	In config/database.php we can see many database connection like sqlite,mysql,pgsql..etc
	we can change it.
	In config/database.php
		'connections' => [

        'sqlite' => [
            'driver' => 'sqlite',
            'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', database_path('database.sqlite')),
            'prefix' => '',
        ],

        Note: here "database.sqlite" means we have to create a file in database/sqlite

Step 3:
	Then create a file name database/database.sqlite or 
	we can use this command "touch database/database.sqlite"

Step 4:	
	then "php artisan migrate"
	it can migrate user and password table

Step 5:
	If we goto the "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" in web browser we can see two new section LOGIN and PASSWORD becouse we run command "php artisan make:auth"

Step 6:
	 If we goto HomeController.php we can see constructor like 
	  	-public function __construct()
	    {
	       $this->middleware('auth');
	    }
	    Note1: this function says every action that on this controller need to pipe through the auth middleware
	    Note2: check what middleware? in laravel.com

	    -public function __construct()
	    {
	       $this->middleware('auth',['only' => 'index']);
	       //$this->middleware('auth',['except' => 'index']);
	    }
	    Note3: we can say the middleware auth will apply only for 'index' page
	    or
	    	we can say the middleware auth will apply acept for 'index' page







Step 7:
	Then goto App/Http/Middleware/Kernel.php we can see

	#$middleware
	//* These middleware are run during every request to your application.
	 protected $middleware = [
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\CheckForMaintenanceMode::class,
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\ValidatePostSize::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\TrimStrings::class,
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\ConvertEmptyStringsToNull::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies::class,
    ];


	    -\Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\CheckForMaintenanceMode::class,
		   	Then goto CheckForMaintenanceMode.php file and can see
		     public function handle($request, Closure $next)
		    {
		        if ($this->app->isDownForMaintenance()) {
		            $data = json_decode(file_get_contents($this->app->storagePath().'/framework/down'), true);

		            throw new MaintenanceModeException($data['time'], $data['retry'], $data['message']);
		        }

		        return $next($request);
		    }
		    Note: this isDownForMaintenance means 
		    	-if we run a command "php artisan down"
		    	and try to access browse our website it can show an message 
		    	like - "Be right back."

		    	-If we want to live again run this command
		    		"php artisan up"


	#$routeMiddleware
	protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'auth' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
    'auth.basic' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateWithBasicAuth::class,
    'bindings' => \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
    'can' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authorize::class,
    'guest' => \App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
    'throttle' => \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests::class,
	];
		-'auth' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
			A particular route should only be available your subscriber. If you are not singin or login you can not access this page

		-'can' => \Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authorize::class,
			It dose the user has permission, it dose the user has roll perform this action

		-'guest' => \App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated::class,
			guest is opposite in auth. Certain pages you can see them as a guest like signup page

Step 8:
goto App/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php
and see how register controller work

Step 9:
-It we reset password it will send me a mail....but this time I can not setup  mail so that why goto .env file

	MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
	MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
	MAIL_PORT=2525
	MAIL_USERNAME=null
	MAIL_PASSWORD=null
	MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
	Note: check a mail_driver  supported in laravel for that got to config/mail.php
		 /*
	    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	    | Mail Driver
	    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	    |
	    | Laravel supports both SMTP and PHP's "mail" function as drivers for the
	    | sending of e-mail. You may specify which one you're using throughout
	    | your application here. By default, Laravel is setup for SMTP mail.
	    |
	    | Supported: "smtp", "sendmail", "mailgun", "mandrill", "ses",
	    |            "sparkpost", "log", "array"
	    |
	    */

	    'driver' => env('MAIL_DRIVER', 'smtp'),


	-In this time we use 'log' mail like
		MAIL_DRIVER=log
		MAIL_HOST=mailtrap.io
		MAIL_PORT=2525
		MAIL_USERNAME=null
		MAIL_PASSWORD=null
		MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null

	-Then goto browser and click forget password
	-A link given in stroge/logs/laravel.log
	-Copy this link and reset password
		link like-"http://localhost/password/reset/4a6992287b740eec751aa1dc48590f46206ef7570c824cb6502c84373f1f066e"
		Note: it not gona work so try this-
			http://127.0.0.1:8000/password/reset/4a6992287b740eec751aa1dc48590f46206ef7570c824cb6502c84373f1f066e
