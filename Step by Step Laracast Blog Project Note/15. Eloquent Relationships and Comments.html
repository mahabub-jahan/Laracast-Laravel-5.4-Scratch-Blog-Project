#RelationShip between Comment and Post

	class Post extends Model
	{
	    public function comments()
	    {
	        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
	    }
	}

	In Tinker:
	 -$post = App\Post::find(6);
	  Note: it will show the value in posts database
	 	-$post->comment //it not call as a method but call as a property
	 	Note: we fetch only the comments that have a "post_id" equal to "id" of the post

	In show.blade.php:
	@extends('layouts.master')

	@section('content')
	    <div class="col-sm-8 blog-main">
	        <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>

	        {{ $post->body }}
	        <hr>

	        <div class="comments">
	            <ul class="list-group">
	                @foreach($post->comments as $comment)
	                    <li class="list-group-item">
	                        {{ $comment->body }}
	                    </li>
	                @endforeach
	            </ul>
	        </div>
	    </div>
