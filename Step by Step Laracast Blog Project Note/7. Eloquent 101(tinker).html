# Eloquent is Larave active record implementation
#tinker
-It boot up laravel shell
-It gives nice way to interect with application
command: php artisan tinker
		-App\Task::all() Note: here Task is a model name
		-App\Task::where('id','>',2)->get();
		-App\Task::pluck('body');
		-$task = new App\Task;
			-$task->body = 'Go to the market'
			-$task->completed = flase;//it apply when completed is not set like ->default('false');
			-$task->save();

#Model:
command: php artisan help make:model

- we can create a static funtion to set a query in model
	Example:
	public static function incomplete()
    {
        return static::where('completed', 0)->get();
    }

    NB: this function has a problem, it can fetch data only specific query

    Now in tinker:
    	-App\Task::incomplete();

-But if we can user sconpe---() function it will fetch not only specific query but also all query
	Example:
	public static function scopeIncomplete($query)
    {
        return $query->where('completed', 0);
    }
    Now in Tinker:
     -App\Task::incomplete()->get();
     	Note: it return an instant Eloquent Bulider like "Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection" then it execute query
     - App\Task::incomplete()->get();
     	Note: in this time we can also execute other sql command like- App\Task::incomplete()->where('id','>=',1)->get();
